in pom first step is page layers you have to define your pages then create packages then create page classes 

   1.creating config properties under config package it is important in pom and storing all my data in config prop as a key and value format 
   
   2.inside the base page im definig my web driver creating two generic method one for initializing browser 
   second method reading property file from properties file after init web driver return driver and after init prop return prop driver 
   
   3. going login page extends base page   keep in the mind in every page we have to create login page object 
   in every page has to has page object BY Or
   and page actions like creating generic method do login, get page title, verify signup link its has to be sequently once login page created finished 
   then start to write login page test class 
   
   4. in test package we write test annotations 
   before method after method 
   then init my prop file because before driver i need to read prop in set up method 
   
   
   note: never write any method which is starting driver. inside testNG test classes its very bad approach 
   another thing never write any assertion in page classes assertion has to implement inside the test class in testNG 
   pages should return either driver or new page or something else never assertion in page
